# RestaurantManagementSystem

This program was built for a final project in my CPS 255 programming class at the University of Wisconsin Washington County.

Most of the GUI elements were built using a plugin for Eclipse called WindowBuilder.

If you want to actually run and use the program outside of an IDE, download the Jar folder.

If you want to bring the code into an IDE to view/edit, download the Objects and GUI folders.
